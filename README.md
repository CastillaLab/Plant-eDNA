# eDNA Metabarcoding for Monitoring Plant Biodiversity in Michigan Inland Lakes

## Overview

This repository contains the data, code, and documentation for the manuscript titled:

"Seasonal and landscape influences on plant diversity in freshwater ecosystems: Insights from eDNA metabarcoding."

Freshwater ecosystems are essential to global biodiversity and human well-being, yet they face escalating threats from anthropogenic activities. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding offers a non-invasive method to monitor plant diversity at the catchment-level, gathering information of freshwater and upland plant communities. This study evaluates the ise of eDNA to quantify plant community composition and diversity across 22 lakes inland lakes in Michigan, including aquatic, wetland and terrestrial species.
